**Horizon** is an all-in-one library for registering, executing, coordinating events on application level.

**Key Principles:**

*   **Event Versatility:**  Any object can seamlessly transform into an event, providing unparalleled flexibility in your application's event-driven architecture.
*   **Lock-Free Concurrency:** Prioritizes atomic operations over traditional locking mechanisms to achieve high-performance, lock-free operation wherever possible.
*   **Dynamic Listener Management:**  Effortlessly register and remove event listeners at runtime, enabling dynamic adaptation to changing application needs.
*   **Extensive Step Modification:** Offers fine-grained control to modify any step in the event processing pipeline, allowing for highly customized event handling.
